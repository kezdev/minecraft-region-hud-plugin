# About
This plugin adds a hud bar showing the server name & the name of the region that the player is standing in. This helps the player know when they're in protected regions and can help them identify who owns it.

Written in Java for Spigot/Paper Minecraft Servers, compiled and tested on Spigot Minecraft 1.19. You can [download the 1.19 compiled jar here](https://we.tl/t-T6ONiZ1l3z).
